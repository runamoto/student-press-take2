        <img class="spin-on-hover" src="pics/small-star.png" /> also known as
        the OCADU Student Press, serves as a platform for idea sharing,
        research, and communication among the OCAD U student and faculty
        community. Over the recent years, the student press has been lost in the
        void, but is back, with the same ethos, to honour the community an the
        press that came before it.
