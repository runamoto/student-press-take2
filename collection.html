            This poster campaign was met with mixed reviews which were clear
            from the vandalization of some found around the main campus
            building. I spoke with Aysia, a 3rd-year cross-disciplinary artist
            who took the initiative and put up posters asking students to scan
            the displayed QR code and voice their anonymous opinions through a
            google forums sheet. With her permission and the permission of her
            group members who also worked on this project, have made the
            responses publically available. Below are all of the responses that

            As a person with,
Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) remains an elusive condition of unknown etiology, in
which patients report chronic widespread pain (allodynia or hyperalgesia) and a variety of
other complaints including fatigue, sleep disorders, cognitive deficit, irritable bowel and
bladder syndrome, headache, Raynaud's syndrome, bruxism, atypical patterns of sensory
dysesthesia, and other symptoms. (Schneider, Brady & Perle, 2006)
            >
            Spending the night without sleep has been a part of my weekly life since I was 10.
Having chronic pain means frequently being so tired that falling asleep is unavoidable,
but waking up is also a sure thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Brazilian summer of 2019, I had the worst pain crisis due to a depressive episode
triggered by grief. I spent two months only having either weeks or a few days of breaks
between episodes. At the time, I would only get out of my house to go to the hospital to
take medication and come back, but even though I was in bed all the time, I only slept 3
hours a day if I was lucky enough to be able to. After the first few weeks of insomnia – "a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep
for at least three nights a week over a month’s time" (Roth, 2007). – I had a specific
episode in which I spent over 24 hours without sleep. Since I was already in sleep debt –
"A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis. The
consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency.
(Spielman, Jenkins & Lovett, 2022) – the consequences were worse. I started
experiencing irritability, and the pain got worse; besides that, I also had severe memory
loss. It was ten times harder for me to retain information, and family and friends had to
repeat themselves constantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the textbook Psychology 2e (Spielman, Jenkins & Lovett, 2022), my
symptoms make perfect sense with sleep deprivation. Irritability, cognitive impairment,
memory lapses, muscular aches and impaired moral judgment are consequences of
getting little to no sleep. Tremors were also cited, which made me realize the tremors I
had were not only part of my other condition but also sleep deprivation.
To conclude, that time of my life made me realize even more how important sleep is to
our body's normal functioning. I don't ever take rest for granted anymore, especially as a
student; having cognitive impairment due to the lack of sleep is the last thing we need
since we are already overworked and tired. Young adults between 18 and 25 years old
have to sleep from 6 to 10 hours a day, according to Psychology 2e (pg. 113), without
considering sleep debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, I will need to prioritize not only sleep but my mental health because another
depressive episode can affect my health even more, jeopardizing all other aspects of my
life, like my career and personal relationships.
