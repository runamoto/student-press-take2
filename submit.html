      <button class="accordion main-acc one">
        Are there any guidelines for submissions?
      </button>
      <div class="panel main-panel">

            <li>
              Here are some *IMPORTANT* Things to note before sending. Your work
              will be reviewed before it is uploaded for the sake of safety and
              precaution. The Student Chronicle is an open and inclusive space
              for you to share your work. However, we kindly ask that you be
              mindful if your content contains the following themes:<br />
            </li>

            <li>
              <b><u>Respect for others:</u></b> It's important to ensure that
              all content submitted is respectful towards others, and does not
              contain any derogatory or discriminatory language or content that
              could be considered offensive or harmful. <br />
            </li>

            <li>
              <b><u>Plagiarism:</u></b> Plagiarism is a serious offense and can
              result in legal action against your publication. Make sure all
              content is original and properly cited if any sources are used
              <br />
            </li>

            <li>
              <b><u>Privacy:</u></b> Respect the privacy of individuals and
              avoid publishing any content that could invade someone's privacy.
              You should also obtain consent from individuals before publishing
              any personal information or images. <br />
            </li>

            <li>
              <b><u>Trigger warnings:</u></b> Consider including trigger
              warnings for content that may be potentially triggering or
              traumatic for some readers. This can include content related to
              violence, sexual assault, or mental health issues. Including
              trigger warnings allows readers to make an informed decision about
              whether or not to engage with the content. However, it's important
              to strike a balance between providing trigger warnings and
              allowing for free expression of ideas and perspectives.<br />

        What kind of content can I submit?

      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          <ul>
            <li>
              We encourage you to submit any kind of written work. The only
              thing we require is that it be more than 100 words. If you are
              submitting photos, we require that you and some sort of supporting
              text.<br />
            </li>

      <button class="accordion main-acc three">
        Are there any specific guidelines for formatting my submission?

      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is no specific, strict format we look for. However we ask
              that the information is clearly split into it's hierarchies e.g.
              paragraphs, title, sources etc.<br />
            </li>
          </ul>
        </button>

      <button class="accordion main-acc four">
        How many pieces can I submit at once?
      </button>
      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          There is no limit as to how many pieces you can submit at one time.
          <br />
        </button>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion main-acc five">
        Will I receive feedback on my submission?
      </button>
      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          Once you send us your submission and it is reviewed, you will recieve
          an email confirming whether or not it corresponded with the
          guidelines. From there you can expect your work to be up within a few
          weeks or days depending on the submission traffic.<br />
        </button>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion main-acc six">
        Will my submission be edited before publication?
      </button>
      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          No. We do not and will not ever edit your work unless asked to. We
          believe that you should be able to speak your voice in the most
          original and authentic way to you.
        </button>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion main-acc seven">
        Can I submit work under a pseudonym or anonymously?
      </button>
      <div class="panel main-panel">
        <button class="accordion sub-acc">
          Absolutely. In the submission form, the last question asks if you
          would like to add any specifications for the anonymity or style of
          content. Here you can specify wether you would like to be anonymous or
          have a specific pen-name. You can even add details like a link to your
          instagram/portfolio/are.na etc.
